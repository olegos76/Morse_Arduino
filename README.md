# Morse_Arduino
Sketch for "arduino nano" microcontroller. It allows to "read" by humans skin some text through a vibromotor using Morse code.

The goal of this project is to help people in some situations, when they need to reproduce a hard-to-remeber information (e.g. on exams).
You can control it through 2 buttons, and it will deliver to you information throw a vibromotor (I got one from old mobile phone).
I will add PCB scheme latter. My prototype has 2 buttons, 1 DC-DC converter, 1 li-ion battery from mobile phone, sim800l, microSD cardreader and vibromotor connected throw transistor.
